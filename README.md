These are my projects from Artificial Intelligence 2 (CS 511) course in UIC

The tasks were to build the best agent which would capture the gold in the wumpus world by obtaining the highest scores. 
I created 4 agents as the part of this course

1. Simple Reflex Agent:
         This was done using simple Condition - Action rules.
2. Model Based Agent:
         Here, an internal model was constructed and based on that the agent performed the actions understanding the environment
3. Goal Based Agent:
         Here, the search branch out on agent actions and possible following observation and based on that the decisions were made by agent
4. Reinforcement Learning:
         Evolution stratergy technique was used instead of the traditional reinforcement learning technique here. Based on that, the agent of learning and was taking the optimal action necessary
